-- | A mesh represents a geometry or model with a single material.
--
-- It usually consists of a number of vertices and a series of primitives/faces
-- referencing the vertices. In addition there might be a series of bones, each
-- of them addressing a number of vertices with a certain weight. Vertex data
-- is presented in channels with each channel containing a single per-vertex
-- information such as a set of texture coords or a normal vector. If a data
-- pointer is non-null, the corresponding data stream is present.
-- 
-- A Mesh uses only a single material which is referenced by a material ID.
data Mesh = Mesh {
  -- | Bitwise combination of the members of the 'PrimitiveType' enum.

  -- normals, but the normals for vertices that are only referenced by point or
  -- line primitives are undefined and set to QNaN
  --
  -- Note:
  -- Normal vectors computed by Assimp are always unit-length. However, this

  -- | Vertex tangents.
  --
  -- The tangent of a vertex points in the direction of the positive X texture
  -- axis. The list contains normalized vectors, NULL if not present. A mesh
  -- consisting of points and lines only may not have normal vectors. Meshes
  -- with mixed primitive types (i.e. lines and triangles) may have normals,
  -- but the normals for vertices that are only referenced by point or line
  -- primitives are undefined and set to qNaN.  See the normals member for a
  -- detailed discussion of qNaNs.
  --
  -- Note:
  -- If the mesh contains tangents, it automatically also contains bitangents
  -- (the bitangent is just the cross product of tangent and normal vectors).

  , textureCoords   :: [Vec3]
  -- | Specifies the number of components for a given UV channel.
  --
  -- Up to three channels are supported (UVW, for accessing volume or cube maps). If the value is 2 for a given channel n, the component p.z of mTextureCoords[n][p] is set to 0.0f. If the value is 1 for a given channel, p.y is set to 0.0f, too.

  -- A bone consists of a name by which it can be found in the frame hierarchy
  -- and a set of vertex weights.
  , bones           :: [Bone]
  -- | The material used by this mesh.
  --
  -- A mesh does use only a single material. If an imported model uses multiple
  -- materials, the import splits up the mesh. Use this value as index into the
  -- scene's material list.
  , materialIndex   :: CUInt
  -- | Name of the mesh.
  --
  -- Meshes can be named, but this is not a requirement and leaving this field
  -- empty is totally fine. There are mainly three uses for mesh names:
  -- 
  --   * some formats name nodes and meshes independently.
  --
  --   * importers tend to split meshes up to meet the one-material-per-mesh
  --   requirement. Assigning the same (dummy) name to each of the result
  --   meshes aids the caller at recovering the original mesh partitioning.
  --
  --   * Vertex animations refer to meshes by their names.
